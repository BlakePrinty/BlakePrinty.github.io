            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I got into software development from playing video games and modifying little bits of code.
                I liked it so much I decided to take some coding classes in high school and that is when I
                knew that I wanted to become a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have lived in Connecticut my whole life and grew up playing sports like lacrosse, football,
                soccer and basketball. After graduating high school, I decided to study Computer Science
                at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I then enrolled in WeCanCodeIT's full-time
                bootcamp specializing in Java.
